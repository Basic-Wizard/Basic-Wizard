# Keenan Raleigh  
### Freelance Bioinformatician | Wandering Data Wizard

Greetings, traveler! I am **Keenan Raleigh**, a freelance bioinformatician and humble servant of the Great Codex of Genomics.  
With scrolls of knowledge earned from the University of Oregon and quests completed across genetics labs, chemistry workshops, and the halls of technical support, I now ply my craft wherever curious data beckons.

I have conjured, maintained, and mended many a bioinformatics pipeline, both in the scholarly towers of academia and the bustling markets of industry.  
My tools are varied, my experience vast, and my passion endless. Whether it is genomes to be aligned, mysteries hidden in vast databases, or tangled scripts in need of unweaving, I am always eager for the next grand adventure.

Should you require a data wizard to aid your journey â€” you need only call.
